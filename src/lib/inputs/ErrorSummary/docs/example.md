In this example, the `items` array is not used, and the error is described using text/html.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<script>
  import { ErrorSummary } from "@onsvisual/svelte-components";
</script>

<ErrorSummary title="There was an error">
  This is a text to describe the error.
</ErrorSummary>
```
