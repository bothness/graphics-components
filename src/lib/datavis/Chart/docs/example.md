In this use case, all of the data and config are passed into the component via a single `section` prop.

This is optimised for robo-journalism projects, where a chart is defined within a section block in a PUG template. The component is used in this way within the [robo-embed](https://github.com/ONSvisual/robo-embed/) and [robo-article](https://github.com/ONSvisual/robo-article/) templates.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<script>
  import { Chart } from "@onsvisual/svelte-charts";

  //the section is normally generated by the pug file
  const section = {
    "id": "chart-density",
    "chartType": "bar",
    "title": "Densest local authorities in the South East, 2020",
    "footer": "Source: Office for National Statistics",
    "data": [
      {"x": 5315, "y": "Portsmouth"},
      {"x": 5070, "y": "Southampton"},
      {"x": 4596, "y": "Slough"},
      {"x": 3969, "y": "Reading"},
      {"x": 3522, "y": "Brighton and Hove"}
    ],
    "padding-left": "120"
  };
</script>

<Chart {section}/>
```
