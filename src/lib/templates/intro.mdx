# Using templates

This section includes a series of starter templates constructed from multiple components within this library. Similar templates to these examples are included in the [sveltekit-starter](https://github.com/ONSvisual/sveltekit-starter) project, which is typically the easiest way to use them.

When using these templates in an existing SvelteKit project (or one built from scratch), you will need to include the **main.css** file from this library, which is best imported to your top-level `+layout.svelte` file in Svelte Kit. By doing this, you will not need to include it on individual pages.
